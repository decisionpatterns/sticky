Title: Persist Attributes Across Data Operations
Description: In base R, object attributes are lost when objects are modified by
    common data operations such as subset, filter, slice, append, extract
    etc. This packages allows objects to be marked as 'sticky' and have
    attributes persisted during these operations or when inserted
    into or extracted from recursive (i.e. list- or table-like) objects.
