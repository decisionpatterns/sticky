Title: Persist attributes through data manipulations
Description: In base R, attributes when the objects they described are changed.
    By marking objects 'sticky', attributes become resilent to normal data
    manipulation operations: subsetted, extended, appended, etc. or when
    inserted into or extracted from list-like objects such as data frames or
    data tables. 'sticky' works on both atomic and recursive objects.
